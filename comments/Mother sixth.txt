I love the GO tutoring program. I love the support it provides. I wish many more kids could have the experience of the program because it is so awesome. Mrs. Hatt has helped my daughter so much with math that her confidence is much better. Mrs. Hatt is like a friend to her-she even comes to her music concerts.
