Without GO, my daughter wouldn't be anywhere near where she is now. She'd be passing fifth grade, but just barely, with her ADHD. Miss Sheila has had a great impact on her. She tailored a special program for her that changed her view of who she is as a person. She knows she is smart but now she feels important and special. Now she feels proud of herself. As a single parent working a minimum wage job, I could never provide this for her. Miss Sheila gives her so much more and she is a friend, a real person, too.
