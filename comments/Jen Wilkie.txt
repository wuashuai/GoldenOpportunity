"GO tutors weave a bond of commitment to a child's future that is a rare gift. I watch the impact these relationships have on children, their growing self-esteem, their empowered way of viewing their education and the impact is truly profound. A gift of a lifetime is what comes to mind. This program is truly a golden opportunity."
