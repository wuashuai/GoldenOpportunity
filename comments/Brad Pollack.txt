"I have observed firsthand what a valuable connection that the tutors establish with their students. Each GO tutor becomes a surrogate family member, meeting with their young person regularly and showing a genuine interest in the life of the student they are paired with, so that each student now has a tutor, coach, mentor and friend. What young person wouldn't benefit from having another trusted adult cheering for them in their corner?"
